## üëã About Me:

At the moment I work as a content manager, but I started to develop towards frontend development. My goal is to become a front-end developer and improve my knowledge of English to the Advanced level. I don't have full experience in development, only in editing code and writing small parts, but I really want to develop, because my position now requires entering a new path of development. I remember that from the age of 9 I began to be interested in computers and website development, I was very interested in how it works.
